## Summary

`vxn2-clap` (2072 lines) re-copies helpers that
`vxn-core-clap` already exports, each drifting independently.

1. **`batch_range`** (`vxn2-clap/src/lib.rs:414-429`) is a
   verbatim copy of `vxn_core_clap::batch_range` (same body,
   "Mirrors VXN1" comment). Delete; import core's.
2. **`dispatch_event`** (`lib.rs:435-488`) duplicates
   `vxn_core_clap::dispatch_event` — the NoteOn/NoteOff/MIDI
   bend/CC1/CC64/aftertouch arms are byte-identical. The
   genuine difference is vxn-2 writes through to the shared
   store (`local.apply_input(shared, …)`) instead of using
   the `on_param` callback. Extract the MIDI/note arms into a
   shared `dispatch_notes` in core that both call, leaving
   only the param-write seam per-synth.
3. **`LocalParams::emit`** (`local.rs:164-203`) re-implements
   the gesture bracket logic from
   `vxn_core_clap::local::LocalParams::emit`. The pure
   decision `bracket(changed, cur, prev) -> (bare, begin,
   end)` is already unit-tested in core — extract it there
   and call from vxn-2's `emit` (vxn-2's `end_time =
   frame_count.saturating_sub(1)` guard is correct; keep it).
4. **Controller construction is repeated in 3 sites** —
   `new_main_thread` (`lib.rs:124`), the `mk_main` test helper
   (`:669`), each calling `set_echo_param_writes(false)` +
   `set_init_preset_meta`. Extract
   `make_vxn2_controller(shared) -> Controller<SharedParams>`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `vxn2-clap`'s private `batch_range` is deleted; it
      imports `vxn_core_clap::batch_range`.
- [ ] The NoteOn/NoteOff/bend/CC1/CC64/aftertouch arms live
      once in `vxn-core-clap` (`dispatch_notes` or equivalent)
      and are called from both synths; vxn-2 keeps only its
      shared-store write-through.
- [ ] The gesture-bracket decision is a single pure fn in
      `vxn-core-clap`, consumed by both `LocalParams::emit`
      impls.
- [ ] A `make_vxn2_controller` factory is the one
      construction path used by `new_main_thread` and
      `mk_main`.
- [ ] `cargo test -p vxn2-clap` green; gesture begin/end
      balancing and the dispatch arms keep their existing
      test coverage (add parity tests if the extraction lacks
      them).

## Notes

The write-through-to-shared-store approach is architecturally
different from vxn-1's `on_param`-callback path — do not
collapse the two; only the MIDI/note arms (which are
identical) move to core. The deep review confirmed vxn-2's
inactive-flush path is **not** buggy (all-ones dirty seed
masks it — see epic Notes); do not "fix" `flush` here.
`drain_dirty_bits` (`lib.rs:210`) and its `force_rate_refresh`
hot-path `Vec` alloc are noted but out of scope — they belong
in vxn2-app, ticket separately if pursued.
